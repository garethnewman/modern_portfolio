                <p>So this is just a brief snippet about me, and a snapshot of my recent and relevant work experience in
                    tech. I don't have a favourite language, I am curious and always playing with new languages. In my day
                    job I am a SQL Server DBA, outside of work and code I like rock climbing, hiking, gaming and having fun
                    with my family. Most of my DBA/Dev experience comes from on the job experience and personal study, I
                    studied civil engineering at college and university but ultimately it was tech that I had a passion for.

                <h3>THG</h3>
                <h6>SQL Server DBA</h6>
                <p>I look after SQL Server from 2008 up to 2016, THG has such a fast pace agile environment and is a rapidly
                    growing company so every day is challenging and rewarding, really enjoying my time at THG.</p>

                <h3>Hallmason</h3>
                <h6>C# Developer</h6>
                <p>I switched my Steel Detailing/CAD role out to be a C# developer instead, building internal applications
                    using the Tekla Structures API, Hallmason estimate the software saves them hundreds of hours each year
                    and they love it, very rewarding getting great feedback on something you built.</p>

                <h3>Atos</h3>
                <h6>IT Helpdesk</h6>
                <p>This is where my IT career started, working on the helpdesk for Atos, supporting a wide and varying range
                    of clients. I made life long friends here but after around 4 years I left to study civil engineering.</p>
